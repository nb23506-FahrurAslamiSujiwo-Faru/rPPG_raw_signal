## Abstract
This study evaluates the effectiveness of Elliptic, Chebyshev1, and Butterworth filters in remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signal processing across various skin tones. Using video recordings and fingertip PPG from 19 subjects of diverse ethnic backgrounds, signals were extracted and filtered. Results show that the Elliptic filter yielded the best performance (RMSE: 1.751, SNR: 5.536), followed by Chebyshev1 and Butterworth. Among rPPG methods, ICA and PCA showed the highest accuracy. The study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate filters and methods to ensure accurate heart rate estimation across different skin tones.
